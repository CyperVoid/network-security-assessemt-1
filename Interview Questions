Open Ports and Scanning
1. What is an open port?
An open port is a specific channel of communication on a computer or server that is actively listening for incoming data. If a port is open, it means there is a service (like a web server or an email program) running and ready to accept connections through that channel.

2. How does Nmap perform a TCP SYN scan?
A TCP SYN scan (or "stealth scan") is done by Nmap sending a SYN (synchronization) packet to the target port.

If the port is open, the target sends a SYN-ACK reply.

If the port is closed, the target sends a RST (reset) reply. Nmap then drops the connection, avoiding the full handshake, which is why it's considered "stealthy."

3. What risks are associated with open ports?
The main risks are:

Exposure: An open port gives an attacker a potential entry point into the system.

Vulnerability: If the service running on the open port (e.g., an old web server) has known flaws, an attacker can exploit those vulnerabilities to gain control.

Misconfiguration: If the service is running with weak passwords or unnecessary permissions, it can be easily compromised.

4. Explain the difference between TCP and UDP scanning.
TCP Scanning: Checks ports for services that require a reliable, two-way connection (like HTTP, SSH). It's easy to tell if the port is open or closed based on the SYN/SYN-ACK response.

UDP Scanning: Checks ports for connectionless services (like DNS, DHCP). It's harder because UDP doesn't require an acknowledgment. An open port often gives no response, while a closed port often returns an ICMP "Port Unreachable" message.

5. How can open ports be secured?
Open ports can be secured by:

Minimizing Exposure: Closing any ports that are not absolutely needed (only keep necessary ports open).

Firewalling: Using a firewall to restrict access to open ports (e.g., only allowing connections from specific, trusted IP addresses).

Patching: Ensuring the software/service running on the port is fully updated and patched to fix known vulnerabilities.

Configuration: Running services with the least amount of privilege necessary.

6. What is a firewall's role regarding ports?
A firewall acts as a traffic cop between your network and the outside world. Its main role regarding ports is to:

Block Unwanted Traffic: It denies all incoming connection attempts to ports that should remain invisible (closed or filtered).

Filter Traffic: It only allows specific, authorized types of traffic to reach necessary open ports (e.g., only allowing HTTP traffic on Port 80).

7. What is a port scan and why do attackers perform it?
A port scan is a technique used to determine which ports are open and listening on a target machine. Attackers perform it because it helps them build a map of the target's services, allowing them to:

Identify running services (e.g., "This server runs a web server").

Find vulnerabilities by identifying services that might be old or unpatched.

8. How does Wireshark complement port scanning?
Wireshark complements port scanning by allowing you to see the exact packets being sent and received during the scan. This is useful because:

Verification: It lets you visually confirm why Nmap marked a port as open, closed, or filtered by observing the actual SYN, SYN-ACK, or RST packets.

Troubleshooting: It helps determine if a firewall or network device is silently dropping packets, which can explain why a scan result might be misleading.
